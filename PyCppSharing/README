      PyCppSharing
==========================

Shows how to run both python and c++ algorithms (GATE) in the same job.
C++ (MyTest) and Python (PyAlgo) algorithm examples just take histograms 
and variables from each other. MyTest (which needs to be compiled) is a 
GATE-based analysis library originally generated with myGateModule script.
